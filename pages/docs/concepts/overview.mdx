# Concepts Overview

Understanding the core concepts of Observa will help you get the most out of the platform.

## Core Concepts

### Traces

A **trace** represents a single LLM call or operation. Each trace contains:

- Request details (query, context, parameters)
- Response data (completion, tokens, latency)
- Metadata (timestamps, user ID, session info)
- Performance metrics (latency, token usage, cost)

Traces are the fundamental unit of observability in Observa.

### Sessions

A **session** represents a user's interaction session, typically a conversation. Sessions group related traces together:

- Multiple messages in a conversation
- User interaction over time
- Context and history preservation

### Conversations

A **conversation** is a sequence of related messages between a user and your LLM application. Conversations help track:

- Multi-turn interactions
- Context flow
- User journey through your application

### Events

**Events** are custom markers or milestones you can track:

- User actions
- System events
- Custom metrics
- Business logic milestones

## Data Flow

```
Your Application
    ↓
observa-sdk (tracks calls)
    ↓
observa-api (processes & stores)
    ↓
observa-app (visualizes & analyzes)
```

1. Your application makes LLM calls
2. The SDK wraps and tracks these calls
3. Data is sent to the API
4. The dashboard displays and analyzes the data

## Key Features

### Tracking

Automatically track all LLM interactions with minimal code changes. Wrap your existing LLM calls with `observa.track()`.

### Analytics

View comprehensive analytics on:
- Usage patterns
