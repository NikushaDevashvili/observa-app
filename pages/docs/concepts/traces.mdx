# Traces

Traces are the foundation of observability in Observa. Learn how they work and how to use them effectively.

## What is a Trace?

A **trace** represents a single LLM call or operation. Every time you call `observa.track()`, a trace is created and sent to Observa.

## Trace Structure

Each trace contains:

### Request Data
- `query`: The user's input or prompt
- `context`: Additional context or retrieved information
- `parameters`: Model parameters (temperature, max_tokens, etc.)

### Response Data
- `response`: The LLM's completion
- `model`: The model used
- `tokens`: Token usage (input + output)
- `latency`: Response time in milliseconds

### Metadata
- `timestamp`: When the call was made
- `conversationId`: Links related messages
- `userId`: User identifier
- `sessionId`: Session identifier

## Creating Traces

Use `observa.track()` to create traces:

```javascript
await observa.track(
  {
    query: "What is machine learning?",
    context: "User is learning about AI",
    conversationId: "conv-123",
    messageIndex: 1,
  },
  async () => {
    // Your LLM call
    return await callLLM("What is machine learning?");
  }
);
```

## Trace Types

Observa tracks different types of operations:

- **LLM Calls**: Direct model interactions
- **Tool Executions**: Function calls and tool usage
- **Retrieval**: Vector search and RAG operations
- **Embeddings**: Embedding generation
- **Custom Events**: Your own tracking events

## Viewing Traces

View traces in the dashboard:

1. Navigate to **Traces** in the dashboard
2. Filter by date, user, conversation, or model
3. Click on a trace to see detailed information
4. Analyze performance and costs

## Best Practices

1. **Add Context**: Include relevant context to help with debugging
2. **Use Conversation IDs**: Group related messages together
3. **Include Metadata**: Add user IDs, session info, and custom fields
4. **Error Handling**: Traces help identify and debug errors
5. **Performance**: Monitor latency and token usage
